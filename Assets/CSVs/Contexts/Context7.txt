Late on a Friday Employee 1 tells you that they won't be able to complete a report due Monday before it's due.  They say that it is because the database that is required for the report can only be accessed at work. Employee 1 asks if they can copy the database onto a drive and finish the report over the weekend. The database contains highly sensitive medical data, but Employee 1 says they will be careful.
