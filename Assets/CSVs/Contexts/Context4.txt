You notice Employee 1 consistently working late recently and ask why. They explain they have a lot of work to do on a project that you know was assigned to Employee 2, and that Employee 2 had asked for help and also happens to do so quite frequently. Employee 1 says that they can usually manage and thinks it really helps Employee 2 out a lot.
