Employee 1 reports to you that they have found a huge new client but has some concerns. The client has a shady background and is under investigation for defrauding shareholders. They have also been fined previously for another immoral act. The client would be one of your company's biggest clients and would massively help the company finances, but Employee 1 is still concerned.
